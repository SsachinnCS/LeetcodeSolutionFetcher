"This project allows users to search LeetCode problems by name and fetch solutions from a GitHub repo. It supports C++, Python, and Java, and also lets users download the solution as a themed PDF. Iâ€™ve styled it for mobile, used highlight.js for syntax highlighting, jsPDF for PDF export, and added protection against DevTools inspection. I can easily connect this to Firebase or a backend too."
